# LeiPublication
Here is the repository for my publication during my PhD studying
1. The first project is for multi-label classification tasks. We used the strategy of the typical dimentionality reduction method Linear Discriminant Analysis and a probabilistic saliency estimation method to build our algorithm. For the details, please check the folder SwLDA.

2. The second project is for anomaly detection on road surface or medical images containing tiny tissues. I need more time to complete the experiment and publish all. 

3.
