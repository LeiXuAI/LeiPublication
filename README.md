# LeiPublication
Here is the repository for my publication during my PhD studying
1. The first project is for multi-label classification tasks. We used the strategy of the typical dimentionality reduction method Linear Discriminant Analysis and a probabilistic saliency estimation method to build our algorithm. For the details, please check the folder SwLDA.

2. The second projecti is for anomaly detection on road surface. I need time to publish code.
