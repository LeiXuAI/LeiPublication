# Saliency-based weighted Multi-label Linear Discriminant Analysis

This is my first journal work for my PhD studying, which is about Multi-label classification tasks. This work is based on the software pakeage ML-FE1.12 from [1]. 

## Getting Started
This project is based on linear discrimiant analysis and a probabilistic saliency estimation model to build a novel method for multi-label classification tasks. The preprint paper is provided https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04221


### Prerequisites
Matlab

## Running the tests
Run this code under as follow:
./Validation/test_dataset.m


### Various methods
Choose the transform type according to comments and your requirements
