This work is about anomalous conditions detection on road surface images (cracks) and fundus images (retinal vessels).
The characteristics of both anomalous conditions is weer, which means the proportion of anomalous conditions pixels to the a whole
image is quite small. This task can be considered as segmentation on imbalance datasets. 

The architecture is based on the U-Net and conditional GANs using Tensorflow.

Waiting for my publication! The target of this work has been changed to a journal. The waiting period will be extended.
